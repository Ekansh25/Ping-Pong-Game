# Ping-Pong-Game
Ping pong, also known as table tennis, is a fast-paced sport played on a rectangular table with a net in the middle. Players use small paddles to hit a lightweight ball back and forth across the table, aiming to score points by making the ball land in the opponent's side of the table.
